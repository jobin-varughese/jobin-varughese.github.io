  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Jobin Varughese</p>
  <p><strong>Why I’m in this class:</strong> I’m taking this class to better understand how people coordinate work in real settings, especially within educational contexts, when collaboration spans between tools and learning systems. I’ve also been following Computer supported collaborative Learning (CSCL) research and hope to publish in that venue. I’m interested in the tradeoffs tools create (speed vs. clarity, engagement vs. outcomes, visibility vs. overload) and how design choices shape group behavior in academic contexts.</p>

  <h2>Collaborative Software I Use Regularly</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Friends & family:</strong> I primarily use SMS/iMessage for domestic and WhatsApp for international, FaceTime</li>
    <li><strong>Meetings:</strong> Outlook calendar, Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams (This is my everyday as I work full-time) </li>
    <li><strong>Work coordination:</strong> Email, Canvas</li>
    <li><strong>Collaborative writing:</strong> Google Docs, Microsoft Word/OneDrive</li>
    <li><strong>Project coordination:</strong> GitHub, Asana, TeamDynamix</li>
    <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Outlook Calendar</li>
  </ul>

  <h2> What Helps Most (and What Could Be Better)</h2>
  <p><strong>Features that help the most:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>I find the shared visibility (calendars, shared docs, task lists) and awareness reduces ambiguity about who is doing what.</li>
    <li>Version history (Docs/GitHub) makes changes trackable and reversible.</li>
    <li>Asynchronous communication supports collaboration across different schedules.</li>
    <li>Screen sharing helps align quickly when a problem is easier to show than explain. This is probably my biggest takeaway in CSCW work as I have done multiple trainings virtually.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What could be better:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Notification overload across tools makes it easy to miss important information.</li>
    <li>Context gets fragmented across chat, email, and documents. Sometimes, in spite of collaboration, tool overload could become cognitive overload.</li>
    <li>It can be hard to reconstruct the “why” behind decisions later.</li>
  </ul>
