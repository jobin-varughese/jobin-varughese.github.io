   <strong>Why I’m in this class:</strong><br>
   I’m taking this class to better understand how people actually coordinate work in real settings, especially within edducational contexts, when collaboration spans between tools and learning systems. I have also closely following publications from the Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) conferences and journals, and hope to publish in that venue. I’m interested in the tradeoffs tools create (speed vs. clarity, engagement vs. outcomes, visibility vs. overload) and how design choices shape group behavior in academic contexts.
